# Card Creator

## User Story
```
AS a game enthusiast, 
I WANT to be able to design my own cards for the games that I enjoy playing
SO THAT I can easily create official looking cards and easily download them to share with others.
```
## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a card creator web application: 

WHEN I am on the landing page, 
THEN I see a welcome page explaining the site (briefly) and I see each possible card game that the site can make as tabs in the navbar. 

WHEN I click on a game tab, 
THEN it will bring me to that game's card creator page. 

WHEN I have designed a card,
THEN I will be able to download the card to save on my computer.

```

## Motivation
I have always enjoyed playing board games and video games, and found a particular love of collectible card games with a board element. This started with [Scrolls](https://mojang.github.io/CallersBaneSiteArchive/) (now known as Callers Bane), followed by [Faeria](https://www.faeria.com/). I enjoyed thinking of my own designs for the game and sharing my created content with the community. And so, I decided to make a card creator, starting with Faeria cards, with the intention to break out into other games, particularly any niche games for gaming communities that may not have access to tools to create their own cards.
